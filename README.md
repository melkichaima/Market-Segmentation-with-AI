# Market-Segmentation-with-AI

This repository contains Python code for a Market-Segmentation project. The model is trained on the sales_data_sample dataset ,using k-Means, PCA and an Autoencoder.

## Dataset

The sales_data_sample dataset used for training and evaluation can be downloaded from the following link: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data). It is useful for Sales Simulation training..

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used is based on deep learning techniques. The specific architecture details are mentioned in the code.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
